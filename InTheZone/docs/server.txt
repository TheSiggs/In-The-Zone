How to run the server

 * The server creates a directory called games in the working directory.  The server creates a file in this directory for every game played.  The server must have permission to create this directory and to create files in this directory.

 * The server server reads commands from a named pipe.  Each command must end with a newline character.  The default name for the pipe is server_command.pipe (in the working directory of the server).  The name of the pipe to read from can be customized with the --command-pipe=<filename> command line option.  The server cannot create the pipe itself, and it will not start if the pipe is not present.

 * The following commands are recognised when written to the command pipe:
   TERMINATE - terminate the server process immediately

 * The server logs to stderr.

 * The following command line options are applicable:

 --port=<int>
     Sets the port to listen on for clients
 --command-pipe=<filename>
     The named pipe to listen on for commands
 --name=<string>
     Sets the server name which may be presented to clients
 --maxClients=<int>
     Sets the maximum number of clients that are allowed on the server
 --backlog=<int>
     Sets the server socket backlog value
 --basedir=<path>
		 Sets the directory in which to find the game data, if different from the
		 compiled in game data.
