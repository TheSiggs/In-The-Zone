In The Zone
===========

To make a Windows and Linux build:

```bash
cd InTheZone
./gradlew clean distZip
```

The file to unzip on Linux or Windows is located under
InTheZone/build/distributions/InTheZone.zip

Note that currently, this file requires manual unzipping and 
assumes that Java 8 RE is installed correctly.

Bundled JRE to come.
