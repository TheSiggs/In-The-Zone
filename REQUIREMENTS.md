# High Level Requirements

## Introduction

This file outlines high level requirements as interpreted by Tim Heuer.

### Game Play

We want a PVP game where player 1 and player 2 are sitting in front of separate computers. The computers need to be able to run Java and are assumed to be desktop
based with mouse and meyboard as control devices.
There are exactly 2 teams involved in the game controlled by exactly 2 distinct players. The 2 distinct players can each be a group of people acting as a team,
but essentially there are only 2 control device sets (keyboards and mice).
There are 4 characters per team who are controlled on a AxB grid board. A and B are usually the same while the grid board can have allevated tiles that connect or are
separated.
Each character has items and abilities and those should balance between the two teams. There can be items like throwable bombs, cross bows etc.
An ability, similar to an item, has an activity radius in which it is active and a range (how far this ability can be cast or thrown).
The radius is not a circle but a square.
The game is turn based. So, each team gets a turn with X amount of actions they can perform, depending on there action and movement points. Each movement point 
advances character X by one square horizontally or vertically when the board is
at right angles.
The squares can have textures, harm and traversability difficulty which makes it
more difficult to travel through them.
